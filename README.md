# Outcast
Outcast is a text-based game developed in Unity. The game setting is low fantasy and a little bit of science fiction. For its design, I am inspired by Gothic and Elex, as well as the films New York 1997 and Los Angeles 2013. It is the story of a convict who ended up in hell, a place forgotten by the gods. In the World of the Condemned.
