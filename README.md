# Outcast

> The Hollow is a place forgotten by the gods. It is nothing more than a huge prison, where all sorts of criminals who pose a threat to the order put in place by the current regime are sent. You are one such inconvenient witness. Your place is now in the World of Condemned...

*Outcast* is a text-based game written in [ink](http://www.github.com/inkle/ink) and Unity. The game setting is low fantasy and a little bit of science fiction. For its design, I am inspired by *Gothic* and *Elex*, as well as the films *Escape from New York* and *Escape from L.A.*
